# Tech stack

React, Redux, MaterialUI, TypeScript, KonvaJS

# Notes

Initially I tried to implement the app using core HTML5Canvas but it may take much more time. So I found lib https://konvajs.org/ and used it. If you interested in core HTML5Canvas please check 'main-core-canvas' branch. I pulled KonvaJS pieces from WWW, so they are not pefect TypeScript code (src/components/shapes folder). All other code is typed by me and is valid TypeScript.
